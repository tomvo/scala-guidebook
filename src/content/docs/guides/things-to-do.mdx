# **Things to Do in the Marche**

## **üèñÔ∏è Beaches**

**Nearest sandy beach:** Porto Potenza Picena  
 Only 10 minutes from the agriturismo, this beach offers both equipped areas (rent umbrella \+ beds) and free public sections (*spiaggia libera*). Parking is easy near the train station. For a seafood lunch, we recommend Giamirma, right on the water. Take time for a stroll or gelato in the town's charming main street.

**Nearest pebble beach:** Porto Recanati  
 About 15 minutes away, Porto Recanati has smooth stone beaches with many options for umbrella and sunbed rentals, plus free beach sections. The seafront and old town are lively and perfect for a seaside walk. Plenty of restaurants line the promenade.

**Most scenic beach:** Portonovo & Conero Riviera  
 Dramatic cliffs and turquoise water define this stunning area. Ideal for swimming, snorkeling, and boat tours. Top beach picks:

* Spiaggia di San Michele & Sassi Neri (from Sirolo, accessible by foot or summer shuttle)

* Spiaggia Urbani (near Sirolo)

* Portonovo Bay: Mezzavalle (wild and hike-in), La Vela (with rock formation), and Portonovo (great restaurants: Marcello or Da Emilia)

## **üåΩ Nature & Hiking**

### Monte Conero  
Forests, Mediterranean scrub, and cliffside trails within 30 minutes of the agriturismo. Combine hiking with beach time and a visit to charming towns like Sirolo, Numana, or Portonovo. Try the "Fonte d‚ÄôOlio ‚Äì Monte Conero" trail for panoramic sea views.

### Sibillini Mountains National Park  
 (Macerata province) Alpine peaks over 2,000m, clear lakes, and remote trails. Great for hiking and biking. We recommend using the Komoot app to find hikes that suit your level.

### Interesting spots

* Elcito ("Tibet of the Marche") & Canfaito forest (famous for autumn beech foliage)

* Sarnano: a base for hikes to waterfalls and peaks

* Lame Rosse: unique red rock formations near Lago di Fiastra

* Pizzo Meta and Lago di Pilato for advanced hikers
